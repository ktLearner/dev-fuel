# Dev Fuel
Initially idea was to make it a crowd funding platform for open source project by integrating github graphql api and blockchain based payment system but could not complete (just justifying the name)

- Tried using next-js instead of just react due to server side rendering / seo optimisation ..... and yeah file based routes is much easier
- Graphql is definatey nice as we dont serve extra or less on the plate
- I am not very good with front end and dint give enough time to make it asthetic but kind just brutally does the representation part
- Used tailwind makes job a bit simple due to easy availability of ready to use components
- Used apollo-client api to connect to api


## Getting Started

### Run Locally  
Clone the project  

~~~bash  
  git clone https://link-to-project
~~~


Add a env file with a private key(name it GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY) and yeah we r ready to go

Go to the project directory  

~~~bash  
  cd my-project
~~~

Install dependencies  

~~~bash  
npm install
~~~

Run the development server
~~~bash  
npm run dev
~~~  


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
